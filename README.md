#### About

ACE is a model-based authoring and validation environment for configurations. It
aims at bringing determinism to tool configuration by externalizing the
configuration definition into a separate model file that acts as the expected
layout of the configuration. Additionally, ACE's flexible architecture makes it
easy to integrate any kind of configuration formats. It currently supports JSON,
TOML, Python and Lua.
